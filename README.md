# clj-cloud-playground

A Clojure demonstration project designed to enable you to rapidly spin up and experiment with a Clojure application using Docker, Containerization, and the like.

## Usage

To run locally, do one of:
* Launch a REPL and evaluate `(clj-cloud-playground.core/start)`
* lein run
* lein uberjar, java -jar target/clj-cloud-playground-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

To run using Docker:
1. Build the standalone app with `lein uberjar`
1. Build the image using `docker build --tag=clj-cloud-playground .`
1. Run the app using `docker run -p 3000:3000 clj-cloud-playground`. This will run you app in a local container that exposes port 3000 to port 3000 locally. You might also try these invocations:
   * `docker run -e NREPL_PORT=3001 -p 80:3000 -p 3001:3001 clj-cloud-playground`: Sets the `nrepl-port` variable to to 3001 and map the container's port 3000 to local port 80. This allows you to connect to your running image and do interactive development.
   * `docker run -e IS_PRODUCTION=true -p 3000:3000 clj-cloud-playground`: Sets the `is-production` environment variable to true so you can modify your internal app as appropriate.

Let's say you want to transfer your image to an EC2 instance and not use DockerHub or any other sort of repo. Assuming you have an EC2 instance running and all the correct keys and permissions set up, you can run your app in the cloud by doing the following:
1. On you local machine, run `docker save -o clj-cloud-playground.tar clj-cloud-playground`. This will package up your app as a single archive.
1. On your local machine, run `scp -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pem clj-cloud-playground.tar ec2-user@XXXXXXXXXX.amazonaws.com:/home/ec2-user/` to copy the file to your remote machine. You must fill in the right values for your ssh key and host.
1. On the remote machine, run `docker load -i clj-cloud-playground.tar` to unpack and load your app.
1. On the remote machine, run the app using any of the same commands as you did above.

To use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) to [push an image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/docker-push-ecr-image.html):
1. Using the AWS Console, create a repository (e.g. clj-cloud-playground). It will create a repository with a URI like `XXXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/clj-cloud-playground`.
1. Click the button 'View push commands' at the top right to get the command sequence needed to upload your image.
1. Once you've done the above your image should be hosted in the repo.
1. Now, ssh into the EC2 instance you will be hosting your docker image from. Ensure docker is set up and running by following [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html#install_docker).
1. Ensure you are logged in to ECR by following [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html#registry_auth).
1. Launch the container with `docker run -e NREPL_PORT=3001 -p 80:3000 -p 3001:3001 XXXXXXXXXX.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/clj-cloud-playground &`. Note that the & will run the process in the background.

To stop your app, use `docker ps` to identify the container id then `docker stop id` (id is the container you just identified) to stop the container.

## TODO
Add directions for deployment with Elastic Beanstalk

Figure out how to get the drawbridge middleware working.
